                <code>
                  Hi there, my name is Nirvan Rabbani, and I am a grade 10 student in the MaCS program at William Lyon Mackenzie CI.
                  Over the past little while of my life, I have discovered my love and passion from programming.
                  I spend lots of time researching and learning new things in different programming languages.
                  In the past, I have meddled with Python, processing, Java, HTML, CSS, JS and React.
                  <br><br>
                  However, other than being a developer, I love playing sports. My favourite sports are volleyball and soccer.
                  I have extensive experience playing both these sports and have learned many things that I apply in my life.
                  Also, I am currently RCM level 10 in piano. Playing piano helps me calm down and forget about all the worries in my life.
                  Other than that, I am a loving brother to my 13 year old sister.
                  We have lots of fun together and I always enjoy spending time with her.
                  <br><br>
                  Thanks for visting my portfolio!
