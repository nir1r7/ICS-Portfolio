                <h2>Prerequisite Knowledge and Terms</h2>
                Before proceeding with this tutorial, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic understanding of variables, primitive data types and objects.</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with forms of iteration such as 'for loops' and 'while loops.'</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with forms of conditional statements such as 'if,'&nbsp;'else if' and 'if-else' statements</li>
                    <li>Element: A specific value inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Index: A 0 based positioning system that determines the positions of specific elements inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Array length: the number of elements inside the array. Once the array length is determined, it cannot be changed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself.
                This can be useful when solving problems that can be broken down into small, similar problems.
                A recursive function has a few parts to it. To begin with, there is always a base case.
                A base case is essentially the ending point of the loop that terminates the whole recursive process.
                Without a base case, the method will repeatedly call itself and will end up crashing the program.
                The next part of a recursive function varies from problem to problem. However, in its simplest form, the method will have a 
                return statement that ends up calling itself again along with another operation depending on the problem.

                The interesting thing about recursion is that any recursive function can be recreated using forms of iteration.
                Recursion and iteration are both ways to repeat a set of instructions in Java.
                Throughout the rest of this tutorial, the differences between the two techniques will become clear.

                <h2>Recursion vs Iteration</h2>
                
                Recursion and iteration are both ways to repeat a set of instructions in Java.
                Recursion is when a function calls itself, while iteration is when a loop repeats a set of instructions.

                        <th>Recursion</th>
                        <th>Iteration</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>A recursive functions repeatedly calls itself until a base case stops the recursion.</td>
                        <td>An iterative function is a loop that executes a block of code until a certain condition is met.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Recursion is very easy to read and understand.</td>
                        <td>Iteration can be very confusing and difficult to read.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Recursion can be memory-intesnive and can lead to *stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is very high.</td>
                        <td>Iterative code can more effecient than recursion because it does not involve creating new *stack frames.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <div class="subtext">
                    *stack frame: a data structure used by computer programs to keep track of the execution of a function or subroutine.
