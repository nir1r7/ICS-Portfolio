                <h1>Finals Frenzy</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                
                Finals Frenzy is a single-player game targeted towards people of ages 14 and 15 year olds who want help to make it through exams.
                A cross-sectional survey in the United States has shown that on an average day, 61% of teenagers are stressed over school.
                The cause for the stress comes from a variety of places:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Family tenssions and external pressure</li>
                    <li>Time management stress and meeting deadlines</li>
                    <li>Academic stress and exam pressure</li>
                </ol>
                Knowing these three most predominant causes of stress for teens, we knew that we could help solve two them:
                time mangement stress and exam pressure.
                Our goal is to help people succeed in their exams and build good study habits to help them succeed in school.
                We wanted to create a game that would help anybody have a less stressful time during exam season.
                By teaching and testing the player through a series of level, we tried to accomplish our vision.
                The main objective of Finals Frenzy is for the player to learn how to build good study habits and manage time efficiently to succeed during exam season.
                By the end of the game, players should have built good study skills and time management, as well as learned how to stay focused during exam season.

                <h2>Levels' descriptions</h2>
                <h3>Level 1</h3>
                <div class="img-space">
                    <img class="isp-img" src="./imgs/level1.png">
                </div>
                Level 1 is the primary learning stage of the game.
                Its sole purpose is to teaching the user the different strategies on properly preparing for their final exams.
                The level works in the form of a "slide show," where the user will have to click to go to the next slide of information.
                Occasionally, there are questions that user will answer by clicking on their answer.
                By the end of the level, the user should have solid understanding on what they need to do prior to their exams.
                This level uses OOP for the Slide class and the Button class to maximize the reusage of code.
                <h3>Level 2</h3>
                <div class="img-space">
                    <img class="isp-img"" src="./imgs/level2.png">
                </div>
                Level 2 is the secondary learning level of the game.
                The main difference is that the user will take the role of a player, and will navigate through a maze using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
                The goal of this level is to go to each checkpoint, and answer the corresponding question correctly.
                No worries if the user gets it wrong because they can try again as many times as they would like since this is still a learning level.
                By the end of this level, this player should have a profound understanding of some useful apps, and distractions that they
                should be aware of during exam season.
                This level requried a Player class, Obstacle class, Wall class, Slide class and Button class to execute.
                <h3>Level 3</h3>
                <div class="img-space">
                    <img class="isp-img"" src="./imgs/level3.png">
                </div>
                Level 3 is the third and final level of the game. Ironically, it is the final test for the user.
                A variety of of objects will be falling from the top of the screen. Some of which will be distractions,
                where others are useful study apps. The user will have to navigate the player using the arrow keys from the keyboard
                to doge the distractions and collect the useful objects. If the player hits 3 distractions they lose.
                However, if they survive long enough and get 20 useful objects, they will have beat the game!

                <h2>My contribution</h2>
                For my part of the project, I mainly on figuring out how to get from one slide to another, which was mainly on level 1.
                I also contributed to the majority of level 2. Throughout both these levels, I created a the main classes:
                A Slide class, Button class, CenteredButton class and Wall class.
                The most time saving and interesting out of all 4 were the Slide and Button classes.
                The Slide class was very effective because it had a series of overloaded constructors.
                Moreover, I implemented an algorithm that takes the input text and displays in a series of lines corresponding to its char count.
                This saved my a lot of time. Next, the Button class was fascinating because it was implemented all throughout the game.
                Not only did it display a box and resize depending on the amount of text, 
                but it also had a helper method that checked if it was clicked or not.
                The isClicked(int x, int y) method is my favourite method by far in the entire program.
                It saved countless hours of calculating and estmiating coordinates on the screen.
                Other than these major contributions, as mentioned, I implemented level 1 as well as level 2.
                Furtheremore, I helped around with countless bugs and issues including a brutal lag issue.
