                <h2>Prerequisite Knowledge and Terms</h2>
                Before proceeding with this tutorial, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic understanding of variables, primitive data types and objects.</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with forms of iteration such as 'for loops' and 'while loops.'</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with forms of conditional statements such as 'if,' 'else if' and 'if-else' statements</li>
                    <li>Element: A specific value inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Index: A 0 based positioning system that determines the positions of specific elements inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Array length: the number of elements inside the array. Once the array length is determined, it cannot be changed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                Searching and sorting are very similar concepts. In fact, sorting algorithms use searching algorithms. 
                To begin with, a searching algorithm is a system that searchs an array of elements for a specific value.
                Searching algorithms are very advantageous because they provide an extremely effecient way of find a specific item of data
                in a potentially extremely large data set.
                <br><br>
                Sorting algorithms on the other hand allow searching algorithms to perform better.
                However, in all of its irony, sorting algorithms use searching algorithms within them.
                A sorting algorithm is a system that sorts an array of elements in a particular order.
                Throughout the rest of this tutorial, you will explore different types of sorting algorithms,
                and how each of them use sorting algorithms in their own way.
