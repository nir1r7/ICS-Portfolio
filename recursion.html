                <h2>Prerequisite Knowledge and Terms</h2>
                Before proceeding with this tutorial, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic understanding of variables, primitive data types and objects.</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with forms of iteration such as 'for loops' and 'while loops.'</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with forms of conditional statements such as 'if,'&nbsp;'else if' and 'if-else' statements</li>
                    <li>Element: A specific value inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Index: A 0 based positioning system that determines the positions of specific elements inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Array length: the number of elements inside the array. Once the array length is determined, it cannot be changed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                Recursion is a very interesting yet tricky topic. It is a process where a method calls itself either directly or indirectly.
                This recall ignites a loop where the method may call itself a large number of times. Using a recursive algorithm allows
                certain problems in programing to be solved very easily if understood well enough.
                <br><br>
                A recursive function has a few parts to it. To begin with, there is always a base case.
                A base case is essentially the ending point of the loop that terminates the whole recursive process.
                Without a base case, the method will repeatedly call itself and will end up crashing the program.
                The next part of a recursive function varies from problem to problem. However, in its simplest form, the method will have a 
                return statement that ends up calling itself again along with another operation depending on the problem.
                <br><br>
                The interesting thing about recursion is that any recursive function can be recreated using forms of iteration.
                The only difference being the speed and effeciency of the program. The majority of the time, recursion is much faster
                than iteration. This concept is very advantageous to know for competitive programmers as they are always striving 
                for the most effecient piece of code. Moreover, writing a recursive function takes less time to code and is much clearer to read.
                Programmers may decide to use recursion for the sole purpose of adding more clarity to their program.
