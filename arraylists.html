                <br><br>
                <h2>Prerequisite Knowledge and Terms</h2>
                Arraylists are extremely simlar to arrays.
                Thus if you are familiar with arrays, learning about arraylists should be relatively easy.
                If you are unfamiliar with arrays, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic understanding of variables, primitive data types and objects.</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with forms of iteration such as 'for loops' and 'while loops.'</li>
                    <li>Element: A specific value inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Index: A 0 based positioning system that determines the positions of specific elements inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Array length: the number of elements inside the array. Once the array length is determined, it cannot be changed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                An ArrayList is a re-sizable array or otherwise known as a dynamic array. It increases in size when elements are added to it,
                and decreases in size when elements are removed from it. It serves the same purpose as a regular array and allows you to access 
                its elements by their index.
                <br><br>
                There are two main differences between ArrayLists and arrays:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>
                        ArrayLists can only contain elements that are objects. Primative reference data such as <i>int</i>, <i>char</i>,
                        <i>boolean</i> and <i>double</i> cannot be placed in an ArrayList. To do so, one must implement 
                        <t class="tooltip">
                            <span class="tooltip-word">wrapper classes</span> <span class="tooltip-text">(A wrapper class is a class that allows a primative data types to be used as objects)</span>
                        </t>
                        such as <i>Integer</i>, <i>Character</i>, <i>Boolean</i> and <i>Double</i> box types.
                    </li>
                    <li></li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
