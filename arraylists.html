                <h1>Arraylists</h1>
                <br><br>
                <h2>Prerequisite Knowledge and Terms</h2>
                Arraylists are extremely simlar to arrays.
                Thus if you are familiar with arrays, learning about arraylists should be relatively easy.
                If you are unfamiliar with arrays, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic understanding of variables, primitive data types and objects.</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with forms of iteration such as 'for loops' and 'while loops.'</li>
                    <li>Element: A specific value inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Index: A 0 based positioning system that determines the positions of specific elements inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Array length: the number of elements inside the array. Once the array length is determined, it cannot be changed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                - An array is data structure used to implement a collection (list) of primitive or object reference data<br>
                - An element is a single value in the array<br>
                - The index of an element is the position of the element in the array<br>
                - Index always starts at 0<br>
                - The length of an array is the number of elements in the array<br>
                - the length of an array can be accessed from any class; public.<br>
                - the length of an array can not be changed after it has been created; final.<br>
                <br><br>
