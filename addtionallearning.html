                            Shmup and Jumpy! are two seperate games that I programmed in python, using Pygame.
                            These two projects were the first few major programming projects that I have done ever.
                            I learned a lot about Python and its exhilarating simplicity.
                            Moreover, I learned the basics and frameworks of game development.

                        <p>
                            Spodissey is one of my most recent projects outside of school.
                            This project was a collaboration with Joshua, Aidan and Patrick, during the LyonHacks-III contest.
                            Spodissey is a website that gets the user to log into their spotify account.
                            From there, the user can click on any country for song recommendations
                            that are germane to their music taste but also popular in the country.
                            As a result of our hard word and determination, we got 2nd in the contest.

                            Metropolis is the website for my school's clubs and activites.
                            As apart of large team, we update and maintain the website all year long.
                            As a new memeber to this club, I am only at the beginning of my journey
                            and will continue to learn and contribute to the website.

                            Elite Calculator is a project that Leo, Alex and I have done for our isp in ICS3UP.
                            There were two main components to this project: the scientific calculator and the graphing calculator.
                            Throughout this project, we became familiar with HTML, CSS and JS, the three most basic programming languages
                            for web development. It was at around this time where I discovered my passion for web development and began
                            engaging in other projects on my own time.
