                <h2>Prerequisite Knowledge and Terms</h2>
                Before proceeding with this tutorial, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic understanding of the Java programming language some of features</li>
                    <li>A basic understanding of variables, primitive data types and methods.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                Object oriented programming, or otherwise known as OOP, is a programming style that involves the creation of objects.
                In order to create objects, we use a sort of 'template' called a class. An object is an instance of a class.
                Every instance of a class is assigned to a variable called the identifier. You will use that identifier to access
                the object's attributes and behaviors. Attributes and behaviors refer to the instance variables and methods respectively.
                Every single object has their own attributes and behaviors as per the class that is has instantiated.

                OOP presents a multitude of benefits. It allows programmers to reuse a piece of code that they have previously written;
                It provides a simple way to create objects; It provides easy access to object attributes and behaviors... All in all, all these
                concepts of OOP provide benefis for large scale systems that involve a myriad of objects. OOP makes it easy to intermingle 
                different pieces of code to produce a grander system.
